Title: Blinding Assessment Indexes for Randomized, Controlled, Clinical Trials
Description: Generate James Blinding Index (1996) and Bang Blinding Index (2004) measures 
             to assess whether or not satisfactory blinding has been maintained in a 
             randomized, controlled, clinical trial. These can be generated for trial 
             subjects, research coordinators and principal investigators, based upon 
             standardized questionnaires that have been administered, to assess whether 
             or not they can correctly guess to which treatment arm (e.g. placebo or 
             treatment) subjects were assigned at randomization.
