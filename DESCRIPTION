Title: Blinding Assessment Indices for Randomized, Controlled, Clinical Trials
Description: Generate James (1996) and Bang (2004) Blinding Indices to assess whether or not 
             satisfactory blinding has been maintained in a randomized, controlled, clinical 
             trial. These can be generated for trial subjects, research coordinators (RCs) 
             and principal investigators (PIs), based upon standardized questionnaires that 
             have been administered, to assess whether or not they can correctly guess to 
             which treatment arm (e.g. placebo or treatment) subjects were assigned at 
             randomization.
